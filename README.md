> It's a project made for twitter, where users can play tic-tac-toe with a bot.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/luisbrandino/jogo-da-velha-bot)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

It is necessary to create a file called config.json where you must place the twitter api keys

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

## How it works?

The bot will automatically create the matches, and people will have to respond to the last tweet with the desired position to play (e.g. 1,2, where 1 is the horizontal row and 2 the vertical row). 

The most voted position in the replies will be chosen, and so the game will continue until it ends.
